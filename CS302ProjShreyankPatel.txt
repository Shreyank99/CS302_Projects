3.	I worked on the main funtion and handling the git repo while my partner Nicholas, worked on writing functions and print statements. The experience from working on this project differed from our pervious projects because both of us had unique styles of coding which 
allowed us to get an insight into a different perpective of thinking. Also maintain the git repo was a new expierence for both of us. 

4a. I'm proud of how i learned how i learned how to use git for group collab through this project and how i effeciently coded the main. 

4b. What i'm least happy about this project is how we handled the print statement. I believe it would be more advantageous for us to create a print funtion that deals with printing all the information. This would be more desirable because it increases the readability of the code.
