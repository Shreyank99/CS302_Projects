### Benchmarking Reflections

1. Discuss the relative performance of each sorting method and try to explain the differences.

    TO DO

2. What do these results reveal about the relationship between theoretical complexity discussed in class and actual performance?

    TO DO

3. In your opinion, which sorting mode is the best? Justify your conclusion by examining the trade-offs for the chosen mode.

### Summary of Individual Contributions

- Hunter Kitts

   Node, List, Quick

   Hunter implemented Node, worked with Shreyank on List, and completed Quick Sort.

- Shreyank Patel 

    List, QSort, STL, Quick

    Shreyank worked with Hunter on List, and implemented both QSort and STL. Shreyank started work on Quick Sort which Hunter followed up on. 

- Andrew Whitus

    Merge, Benchmark, QSort

    Andrew implemented Merge Sort and worked some with Shreyank when troubleshooting QSort. Additionally, Andrew wrote a Python script to generate the random numbers needed for benchmarking. Andrew completed benchmarking and finallized the README.
